## About me

When I was at school, computer science was one of my favorite subjects, but it so happened that my higher education is in economics. In 2020 I started to study software development courses and realized that I was good at it, and I was very passionate about it. In two years I took several courses and eventually chose Frontend, I want to develop in this direction.
